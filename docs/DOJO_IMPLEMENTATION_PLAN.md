```cairo
fn create_game(ref self: ContractState, grid_size: u8, score_limit: u32, word_list_root: felt252) -> u32 {
    let mut world = self.world(@NAMESPACE);
    
    // Generate game ID
    let game_id = world.uuid();
    
    // Create game state
    let game_state = GameState {
        id: game_id,
        grid_size,
        score_limit,

        created_at: starknet::get_block_timestamp(),
    };
    
    world.write_model(@game_state);
    
    // Initialize grid
    self.initialize_grid(game_id, grid_size);
    
    game_id
}
```

### Testing:

        game_id,
        address: player_address,
        name: player_name,
        color,
        score: 0,
    };
    world.write_model(@player);
    
    // Update game state
    game_state.player_count += 1;
    if game_state.player_count == 2 {
        game_state.is_active = true;
        // Random starting player
        game_state.current_player_index = self.random_player_index();
    }
    
    world.write_model(@game_state);
}
```

### Testing:

## Implementation Tips

1. **Always test incrementally** - Don't move to the next milestone until the current one is fully tested
2. **Use hexcore_logic for game logic** - Don't duplicate logic in the Dojo layer
3. **Keep Dojo models simple** - They should mainly store state, not implement logic
4. **Emit events liberally** - They're useful for debugging and client updates
5. **Handle errors gracefully** - Return meaningful error messages

## Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Namespace errors**: Ensure NAMESPACE constant is used consistently
2. **Model compilation errors**: Check trait derivations (Drop, Serde)
3. **Type conversion issues**: Use try_into().unwrap() for numeric conversions
4. **Array mutability**: Remember Cairo arrays are append-only
5. **Grid coordinates**: Ensure consistent use of axial coordinates (q, r)

## Next Steps

After completing all milestones:
1. Optimize gas usage
2. Add additional features (achievements, leaderboards)
3. Implement bot players
4. Create comprehensive documentation
5. Deploy to testnet for broader testing
